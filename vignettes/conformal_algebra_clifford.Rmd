To cite the `clifford` package in publications please use
@hankin2022_clifford.  This short document shows how Clifford algebra
can be applied to conformal geometry using the `clifford` R package;
it follows @hildenbrand2013 and @perwass2009.  Here we work in
$\operatorname{Cl}(p,q)$, which Perwass denotes $\mathbb{G}_{p,q}$.
The set of grade-$k$ objects is denoted $\mathbb{G}_{p,q}^k$.  First
we define the IPNS and OPNS [inner product null space and outer
product null space] of $\ak$:

\[
\mathbb{NI}(\ak)=\left\lbrace bx\in\mathbb{G}^1_{p,q}\colon\bx\cdot\ak=0\right\rbrace
\]

\[
\mathbb{NO}(\ak)=\left\lbrace bx\in\mathbb{G}^1_{p,q}\colon\bx\wedge\ak=0\right\rbrace
\]

Thus if $\ak=\bigwedge_{i=1}^k\ba_i$, then
$\mathbb{NO}(\ak)=\operatorname{span}(\ba_1,\ldots,\ba_k)\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{p,q}$.
Further, $\mathbb{NO}(\ak)$ is linear in the sense that
$\bx,\by\in\mathbb{NO}(\ak)$ implies
$\alpha\bx+\beta\by\in\mathbb{NO}(\ak)$ for any real numbers
$alpha,\beta$.  To work in R, we first set up some basic features of
conformal geometry:


```{r}
dimension <- 3
options("maxdim" = dimension+2)  # paranoid safety measure
signature(dimension + 1,1)
eplus <- basis(dimension+1)
eminus <- basis(dimension + 2)

e0 <-  (eminus - eplus)/2
einf <- eminus + eplus
E <- e0 ^ einf
```

So

```{r}
e0
einf
E
```

Now we can consider Euclidean vectors $\ba,\bb\in\mathbb{R}^3$ and
conformal embeddings $\bA,\bB$ given by

\[
\bA=C(\ba)=\ba+\ba^2\einf/2 +\ezero\qquad\bB=C(\bb)=\bb+\bb^2\einf/2 +\ezero
\]


```{r}
point <- function(x){ as.1vector(x) + sum(x^2)*einf/2 + e0 }
```

Then, for example


```{r}
a <- c(1,2,5)
b <- c(2,2,2)
point(a)
point(b)
```


It can be shown that
$\bA\cdot\bB=-\left\lVert\ba-\bb\right\rVert^2/2$.  Package idiom to
verify this would be


```{r}
c(conformal=drop(point(a) %.% point(b)), Euclidean = -sum((a-b)^2)/2)
```

showing that the two results match.

## Sphere, IPNS

We can define a sphere with center $\ba$ and radius $\rho$ as 

\[
\bS=C(\ba) - \rho^2\einf/2
\]

and then the sphere is just the inner product null space of $\bS$,
that is $\left\lbrace\bx\colon\bS\cdot\bx=0\right\rbrace$.  This is
straigtforward to implement computationally.  Suppose we have a sphere
of radius 5, center $[1,2,3]$:

```{r}
sphere <- function(x,r){ point(x) - r^2*einf/2}
S <- sphere(1:3,5)  # center (1,2,3) radius 5:
S
```

Then object `S` is a conformal representation of such as sphere.  The
radius $\rho$ can be calculated from $\bS^2=\rho^2$ and the center is
given by $P=\bS\einf\bS$.  Package idiom:

```{r}
drop(S^2)   # 5^2 = 25
```

Finding the center of the sphere is slightly more involved:


```{r}
S*einf*S
```

Hildenbrand shows that the scaling factor is $-2$ so this gives us

```{r}
-S*einf*S/2
```

which we recognise as the point $(1,2,3)$:

```{r}
point(1:3)
```


## Sphere, OPNS

We can also consider the OPNS for a sphere, defined in terms of four
points that lie on it.  For example, if our four points are $(0,0,0)$,
$(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, $(0,0,1)$ we would have a rather involved
algebraic calculation resulting in a sphere of radius
$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and center
$\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)$.

The conformal representation for a sphere in OPNS would be 

\[
S^*=P_1\wedge P_2\wedge P_3\wedge P_4
\]

and points that lie on the sphere are the set

\[\left\lbrace\bx\colon\bx\wedge S^*=0\right\rbrace.\]

Observe again that this parameterization does not require one to take
a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$, as all the results are presented in terms
of vector quantities: at no point does one need to consider components
or elements of any vector.  The R idiom for defining the sphere
touching $P_1$ - $P_4$ is straightforward:

```{r}
origin <- point(c(0,0,0))
px <- point(c(1,0,0))
py <- point(c(0,1,0))
pz <- point(c(0,0,1))

origin ^ px ^ py ^ pz
```

And this is the representation for a sphere (translating this into a
center and radius is not yet implemented).  Slightly slicker R idiom might be:

```{r}
spherestar <- function(...){Reduce(`^`,list(...))}
spherestar(origin, px, py, pz)
```

# Planes

A plane is defined as $\bn + d\einf$, where $\bn$ is the unit normal
and $d$ the distance to the origin.

```{r defineplanefunc}
plane <- function(n,d){ as.1vector(n/sqrt(sum(n^2))) + d*einf}
```

For example, we consider the plane $\Pi$ with normal
$\mathbf{n}=\left(1,2,5\right)$ and distance 7:

```{r generatend}
n <- c(1,2,5)
nhat <- n/sqrt(sum(n^2))
d <- 7
Pi <- plane(nhat,d)
Pi
```

Just to check, we may verify that some points known to lie in $\Pi$
are in fact in its IPNS.  We observe that the point
$7\hat{\mathbf{n}}\in\Pi$, and also that vectors $\mathbf{u}=(2,-1,0)$
and $\mathbf{v}=(5,0,-1)$ are orthogonal to the normal of $\Pi$.  So
$7\hat{n} + \alpha\mathbf{u} + \beta\mathbf{v}\in\Pi$ for any real
numbers $\alpha,\beta$.  In R:

```{r generateuvp1p2p3}
u <- c(2,-1,0)
v <- c(5,0,-1)
P1 <- point(d*nhat)                
P2 <- point(d*nhat + 1.3*u + 3.44*v)
P3 <- point(d*nhat - 6.1*u + 1.02*v)
```

Above we use some made-up values of $\alpha,\beta$ to generate `P1`,
`P2`, `P3` which are known to lie in plane $\Pi$.  Then to verify that
these points lie in the IPNS of $\Pi$ we need to take the inner
product with the conformal representation of $\Pi$:

```{r verifyplaneipns}
c(drop(Pi %.% P1),drop(Pi %.% P2),drop(Pi %.% P3))
```

Above we see zero (to numerical precision), showing that we do indeed
have $7\hat{n} + \alpha\mathbf{u} +
\beta\mathbf{v}\in\operatorname{IPNS}(\Pi)$ for at least these values
of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

Alternatively, a plane can be thought of as a sphere that touches the
point at infinity; thus the OPNS of plane is given by

\[
\pi^\star = P_1\wedge P_2\wedge P_3\wedge\einf
\]

where $P_1,P_2,P_3$ are any points that lie in the plane.  To
illustrate this we will use the three points used in the IPNS above:

```{r}
Pi2 <- P1 ^ P2 ^ P3 ^ einf
```

Then for verification we can create another point known to be in the
plane and check that this is in the OPNS.  Below we will use `p4`
which is $d\hat{\mathbf{n}} + 7.6\mathbf{u} - 9.23\mathbf{v}$:

```{r}
p4 <- point(d*nhat + 7.6*u - 9.23*v)
Mod(Pi2 ^ p4)
```

Above we see a very small result showing that `p4` is indeed in the
OPNS of plane `Pi2`.

## Circle

a circle is defined as the intersection of two spheres:


```{r}
circle <- function(S1,S2){  # IPNS
    S1 ^ S2
}
```

For example

```{r}
circle(sphere(1:3,5),sphere(c(1.1,2.1,3.4),6))
```

A circle may be represented in the OPNS by specifying three points
that lie on it:

\[ Z^*=P_1\wedge P_2\wedge P_3\]


```{r}
circlestar <- function(...){  # OPNS; A^B^C
	jj <- list(...)
    stopifnot(length(jj) == dimension)
    Reduce(`^`,lapply(jj,point))
}

circlestar(c(1,2,3),c(5,6,3),c(8,8,-2))
```

# Lines and point pairs

A line is the intersection of two planes; in R:

```{r defline}
line <- function(P1,P2){  # IPNS
    P1 ^ P2
}
```

and a "point pair" is the intersection of three spheres; in R:

```{r defpp}
pointpair <- function(S1,S2,S3){ # OPNS
    S1 ^ S2 ^ S3
}
```


```{r restoredefault}
options("maxdim" = NULL) # restore default
```
