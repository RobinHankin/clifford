# Quaternions using Clifford algebras

Converting quaternions to and from Clifford objects is not part of the
package but functionality and a short discussion is included in
`inst/quaternion_clifford.Rmd`.

## Details

Given a quaternion \\a+bi+cj+dk\\, one may identify \\i\\ with
\\-e\_{12}\\, \\j\\ with \\-e\_{13}\\, and \\k\\ with \\-e\_{23}\\ (the
constant term is of course \\e_0\\).

## Note

A different mapping, from the quaternions to \\\operatorname{Cl}(0,2)\\
is given at `signature.Rd`.
